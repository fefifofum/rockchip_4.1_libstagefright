Copied files from two other repositories:

https://github.com/HermanChen/Rockchip_4.1_release_libstagefright

https://github.com/netlars/hw


Copy them to the work tree to compile stagefright for rockchip. I use them to build CM10, but you'll also need some extra propietary files. Read the instructions in HermanChen's repository, you can find them there.
